# My-Calculator

# Description
It is a simple calculator having all the basic operators like addition, subtraction, mulitiplication, division and percentage where you can evaluate the sum you enter in. It will give you the vibe of calculators present in keypad phones cause it doesn't have much features like the calculators present in smart phones. Calculator is the best project to build for a beginner who is having little confident in Javascript cause it consists very simples lines of code, yet I personally had a small doubt on erasing the numbers one by one which is "clear" button, but however I got it done. Still there is one thing remained undone which is about deriving certain percentage value of a certain number, like, if you want to derive 10% of 100 then it won't return you an empty string.
